# LENDING CLUB LOAN ANALYSIS
Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans, in which investors provide funds for potential borrowers and investors earn a profit depending on the risk they take (the borrowers credit score). Lending Club provides the "bridge" between investors and borrowers. Lending club company makes a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.

The Consumer Finance Company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. The problem is they don’t know whether the customer is good customer or bad customer. They don’t know driving factors behind loan default, i,e the variables which are strong indicators of default. Defaulted customers are who not paying the loan continuously.

The aim of the whole project is to identify the risky loan applicants using EDA, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.


Business Loss: If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company 

Financial Loss: If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company. They are defaulted customers.

The aim of the whole project is to identify the risky loan applicants using EDA, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.

## General Information
The aim of the whole project is to identify the risky loan applicants using EDA, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 

Understand the driving factors behind loan default.

Business problems are Business Loss & Financial Loss, identifying the applicants having tendeency to default can aviod financial loss to company.

Also, approving loan to good grade applicants can aviod Business loss to Company.

Dataset Used: Loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.
 

## Conclusions
 1) Grade – the ratio of defaulters increases from grade A to G.
 
 2) Interest rate – the ratio of defaulters increases with increase in int_rate.

 3) Annual income – the defaulter rate decreases with increase in annual_inc.

 4) Loan Amount - The ratio of defaulters increases as the loan amount increases.

 5) Term – The defaulter rate increases with increase in term

 6) Purpose - The defaulter rate shows some variation wrt to loan purpose.
Small business loans have a higher percentage of defaulters(more than 25%).

 7) Installment amount - Increase in installment amount leads to more defaulters


## Technologies Used

Library  : Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib and seaborn


## Acknowledgements
Solving this assignment will give you an idea about how real business problems are solved using EDA. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques you have learnt in EDA, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
